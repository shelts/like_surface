these are sweeps over ft. They are done by setting the forward and backtime equal. these take the best likelihood reported every timestep after .95 of the sim is complete. they use random iteration in a narrow range around peak

I have added the sweeps over the other parameter with the same other parameters as above.
I will add a wider sweep to fill in the wider space.
